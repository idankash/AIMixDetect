==History==
Algeria's history is a tapestry woven with the threads of ancient civilizations, foreign invasions, and a quest for independence.
This 'History' section provides an overview of Algeria's rich historical journey, from its earliest settlements to the modern era.
Around ~1.8-million-year-old stone artifacts from Ain Hanech (Algeria) were considered to represent the oldest archaeological materials in North Africa.
The earliest evidence of human habitation in Algeria dates back thousands of years.
Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of Middle Paleolithic Flake tool techniques.
Stone tools and cave paintings discovered in Tassili n'Ajjer, in the southeast, serve as reminders of the region's ancient past.
Over time, Berber tribes settled in the area, establishing a society based on agriculture and trade.
Phoenician traders arrived on the Algerian coast around the 12th century BC, establishing trading posts along the Mediterranean.
Stone artifacts and cut-marked bones that were excavated from two nearby deposits at Ain Boucherit are estimated to be ~1.9 million years old, and even older stone artifacts to be as old as ~2.4 million years.
These settlements played a crucial role in North African commerce and culture, leading to the integration of Phoenician, Carthaginian, and indigenous influences in the region.
The Roman Empire later conquered the area, transforming it into the province of Mauretania Caesariensis.
Tools of this era, starting about 30,000 BC, are called Aterian (after the archaeological site of Bir el Ater, south of Tébessa|Tebessa).
Roman rule lasted for centuries, leaving a lasting impact on Algeria's architecture, infrastructure, and culture.
Many Roman ruins can still be seen today, such as the ancient city of Djemila and the Timgad ruins.
In the 7th century AD, Arab-Islamic armies from the east swept across North Africa and brought Islam to Algeria.
The Arab conquest brought significant changes to the region, including the introduction of the Arabic language and Islamic governance.
Hence, the Ain Boucherit evidence shows that ancestral hominins inhabited the Mediterranean fringe in northern Africa much earlier than previously thought.
The Arab-Berber amalgamation forms the basis of Algeria's modern ethnicity and language.
Centuries later, the Ottoman Empire established its rule over Algeria in the early 16th century.
Algerian coastal cities became major centers of trade and piracy, as the Barbary pirates targeted European merchant ships crossing the Mediterranean.
This period marked a time of political instability and conflict, both within the region and with foreign powers.
European colonial powers, most notably France, set their sights on Algeria's resources and strategic importance in the 19th century.
After a series of military campaigns, France established direct control over Algeria in 1830, transforming it into an integral part of French colonial empire.
The French colonization lasted for over a century and profoundly influenced Algerian society, culture, and infrastructure.
Resentment towards French rule grew over time, leading to the emergence of nationalist movements advocating for independence.
The evidence strongly argues for early dispersal of stone tool manufacture and use from East Africa, or a possible multiple-origin scenario of stone technology in both East and North Africa.
The struggle for independence culminated in a bitter war from 1954 to 1962, in which Algerian nationalists fought against French forces.
Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the Levallois technique|Levalloisian and Mousterian styles (43,000 BC) similar to those in the Levant.
On July 5, 1962, Algeria finally gained independence, becoming the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria.
Post-independence, Algeria embarked on a path of socialist policies and centralized governance under President Houari Boumediene.
The country nationalized key industries and invested heavily in education, healthcare, and infrastructure.
However, internal political tensions, economic challenges, and the effects of the global oil crisis in the 1980s presented significant hurdles.
In the 1990s, Algeria faced a period of violent civil unrest following the cancellation of the country's first multiparty elections.
The ensuing decade-long conflict, known as the Algerian Civil War, led to the loss of tens of thousands of lives and inflicted significant damage on Algeria's economy and society.
Since the early 2000s, Algeria has focused on rebuilding and stabilizing its economy.
The country has utilized its vast reserves of oil and natural gas to fuel economic growth and invest in infrastructure projects.
Algeria has also placed emphasis on political reforms and diversification of its economy to reduce dependency on hydrocarbons.
Today, Algeria stands as a regional power with a proud history and a resilient population.
Its rich cultural heritage, stunning landscapes, and ancient ruins make it a captivating destination for tourists and historians alike.
Despite the challenges it has faced, Algeria continues to strive for progress and development, eager to shape its future while honoring its past.

==Economy==

As the largest African country and an OPEC member, Algeria holds the 16th largest oil reserves globally and ranks among the top ten natural gas producers in the world.
The economy of Algeria heavily relies on hydrocarbon exports, which account for around 30% of its GDP and 95% of its total export revenues.
Algeria's currency is the Algerian dinar|dinar (DZD).
The energy sector serves as the backbone of the Algerian economy, providing substantial government revenue and employment opportunities.
Algeria has made notable investments in oil and gas infrastructure, ensuring a robust production and export capacity.
To diversify its economy, Algeria has taken steps to develop other sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and services.

Despite its natural resource wealth, Algeria faces economic challenges, including high unemployment rates, over-reliance on oil and gas revenues, and the need for economic diversification.
The government has implemented social programs and initiatives to address unemployment, improve education and skills training, and encourage entrepreneurship.
Algeria has also invested in infrastructure development, including transportation, telecommunications, and renewable energy.
The government's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages.

The ongoing economic reforms and diversification efforts reflect Algeria's commitment to building a sustainable and resilient economy.
